                        Finished in 1944 and published in 1945, George Orwell's <em>Animal Farm</em> is a political, satirical, and allegorical novel revolving around barnyard animals and their rebellion against their human oppressors. Through this story, George Orwell is able to explore many complex themes, such as power, manipulation, the power of education, and class. Orwell also critiques various historical events, mainly the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union under Stalin. Today, <em>Animal Farm</em> continues to be regarded as a powerful commentary and one of the most influential and brilliant books of all time.

                        George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair) was an English novelist whose work is defined by its powerful social criticism and opposition to totalitarianism.

                        Prior to the Russian Revolution, Russia was a very impoverished country compared to other countries in Europe. To the rest of Europe, Russia was an underdeveloped, barbaric society. When the Industrial Revolution began in Russia, many people moved to major Russian cities to find work. However, these cities were overcrowded and provided very poor living conditions to the incoming population. Food shortages were common across Russia, and a series of wars further weakened the country. Large protests by Russian workers against the monarchy and Tsar Nicholas II were held, beginning the Russian Revolution (History.com).

                        Hundreds of protestors were killed, and laborers responded with strikes, further crippling the country. Now called “soviets”, soldiers and workers banded together to fight oppression. After the first Russian Revolution ended, the country entered into World War I. Already facing a weak economy, Russia was further damaged by the war with high casualties and food shortages. There was a great deal of corruption in the Russian government, and most Russians lost faith in their Tsar, calling for an overthrow. In the February Revolution, demonstrators flooded the streets and clashed with police, fighting for food and the end of Russian involvement in the war. A few days after this demonstration, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne (History.com).

                        A provisional government was established, and Russia continued to face food supply shortages. Later, the Bolshevik Revolution saw the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrow the provisional government and form a communist state. Following the communist takeover of Russia, a civil war broke out between the Bolsheviks and democratic socialists. The war ended in 1923 and Lenin’s army took complete control of the country. After Vladimir Lenin’s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky were the two potential heirs to Lenin. Leon Trotsky was a key figure in the Russian Revolution, and Stalin was a Bolshevik operative who spread propaganda. After a power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky, Stalin came to power and emerged as the leader of the USSR (History.com).

                        As the leader of the USSR, Stalin turned the Soviet Union into an industrial and military superpower. He implemented a series of plans to create economic growth and transform the Soviet Union. Stalin forced the consolidation of individually owned land and livestock in order to increase agricultural productivity. However, agricultural productivity dropped and food shortages affected millions. The Great Famine caused millions of deaths, but this fact was hidden by the USSR and suppressed through propaganda and censorship. Stalin was not hesitant to kill anyone who opposed his leadership using a secret police force. Soviet citizens were killed, deported, and imprisoned in forced labor camps known as Gulags (History.com).

                        Animal Farm begins with a group of farm animals who are being abused and exploited by their owner, Mr. Jones. After Old Major shows them a vision of a society where animals are free from their human oppressors, the animals are inspired to establish their own society. Three boars, Napoleon, Snowball, and Squealer, create a new system of thought named Animalism based on Old Major’s teachings. Soon, the animals rebel against Mr. Jones and are successful. The boars establish the Seven Commandments of Animalism, emphasizing peace and equality among all animals. The farm is renamed “Animal Farm” and it begins to thrive, free of the humans.

                        Before long, Snowball and Napoleon begin to argue about various decisions regarding the farm. However, as they are the smartest animals on the farm, the boars are the only animals that make decisions on the farm. After a major argument over a windmill, Napoleon drives Snowball away with his loyal dogs. This event marks the beginning of Napoleon’s rule over the animals. Napoleon continues to gain power over the animals and take on privileges that were previously forbidden. To justify this, Napoleon uses propaganda, through Squealer’s speeches, and alters the Seven Commandments. The animals are exploited for their work while the pigs refrain from working. The farm continues to decline under Napoleon's leadership.

                        Napoleon announces that the windmill, which was originally Snowball’s idea, will be made and forces all the animals to contribute to building it. When the windmill is destroyed by a storm, Napoleon blames Snowball and uses the incident to grow his power. Any animal who is suspected of disloyalty is killed, and the animals continue to work hard, believing that what they are doing is for the greater good of Animal Farm. Napoleon continues to manipulate the animals, and he changes the commandments to justify any actions that would have been forbidden. Boxer, the hardworking cart-horse, is sent to be killed by Napoleon after he is no longer deemed useful. Rations are reduced for all animals as the farm continues to decline. Napoleon enters into various trade relationships with humans in order to gain materials that the farm did not have access to before.

The pigs walk on two legs, wear clothes, and have dinner with humans. The pigs violate all the old rules of animalism, but they are able to alter the rules and manipulate the animals into thinking they are right. The power has consumed the pigs, and they become the oppressors. What was once the Seven Commandments is now a single principle: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,” (Orwell 123).

In a similar fashion, Tsar Nicholas II, was the oppressive ruler of Russia and was a poor leader, causing food shortages and poor living conditions for his citizens. Both Mr. Jones and Tsar Nicholas II had major roles in the maltreatment of their subjects, creating reason for rebellion. Orwell states, "When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep..., so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer, " (28).

                        Old Major, being the boar that first introduced the idea of a rebellion to the animals, is a clear representation of Karl Marx. Marx was a German philosopher who wrote and published <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> where he predicted that a revolution would end the capitalist system and make the workingmen the new ruling class of the world. This political ideology, called Communism, inspired the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent rule of Joseph Stalin (History.com).

                        <br>
                        Both Old Major and Marx have a vision of a society with equality, free from oppression. However, in both the novel and real life, this vision is twisted for the gain of power hungry individuals.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Snowball and Napoleon are the leaders of the rebellion and represent Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin, respectively. Both pairs worked hard and played key roles in establishing the society they believed would be best. However, differences in ideas would eventually lead to a power struggle between the two.
                        <br><br>
                        Trotsky, like Snowball, was intelligent and a visionary who prioritized progress and stability for the future of the revolution. Snowball’s windmill represented the want for a better society for all animals. 
                        <br><br>
                        Stalin, like Napoleon, opposed his partner and saw him as a threat to his control. Stalin ruthlessly used propaganda and any techniques he could to gain power. Mirroring the events that happened after the Russian Revolution, Napoleon exiled his partner Snowball and gained full control of Animal Farm. Orwell states, "Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal, " (60). Both Napoleon and Stalin, power hungry individuals, ignored the wellbeing of their citizens and prioritized power and wealth.

Similar to the propaganda techniques used in the USSR after Stalin’s rise to power, Squealer displays the “success” of Animal Farm despite the clear food shortages and deaths. Justifying Napoleon's goals, he convinces the animals that they are working for the betterment of all of Animal Farm. In the Soviet Union, Stalin used propaganda in a very similar fashion and changed how the public viewed him and the state of the country through the media (History.com).

                        Boxer is a symbol of the working class of Animal Farm and the Soviet Union. Helping Snowball and Napoleon to revolt against Mr. Jones, Boxer was eventually maltreated and exploited for his work, like the working class that helped to revolt against Tsar Nicholas. Despite facing many setbacks and oppression, Boxer continued to work hard, believing all the propaganda that was fed to him and the idea that his work would be for the benefit of all the animals on Animal Farm. Orwell states, "'If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.' in addition to his private motto of 'I will work harder,'" (60).

                    <p class="lead">
                        By mirroring the events of the Russian Revolution, Orwell is able to create an allegorical story which highlights the dangers of totalitarianism and power. Starting at the beginning of the rebellion, all animals contributed to the cause to create a society where they would all be equal and free. Orwell states, "All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them," (63). However, the lust for power consumes Napoleon as he takes drastic measures to ensure that no one stands in his way. Orwell displays that leaders, like Napoleon and Stalin, will ignore morals and the wellbeing of others for their own personal gain. The windmill, for example, was used by Napoleon to keep the animals busy and in his control. To execute his actions, Napoleon trained a hidden group of vicious dogs, similar to Stalin’s secret police force. Using these dogs to instill fear and silence his opposition, Napoleon exhibits the ultimate corruption of power and dictatorship.

                    <p class="lead">
                        From the beginning of the novel, Orwell made it clear that the pigs who are in charge of the rebellion are smarter than the rest of the animals. When Napoleon came into power, he took advantage of this mental superiority, along with Squealer, to manipulate the animals into blindly accepting his rule. Slowly throughout the novel, Napoleon breaks the commandments that were set at the beginning of the rebellion in the interest of his own greed. However, to justify this, he physically changes the commandments and convinces the animals that their memories are wrong. Because Napoleon freed the animals from the oppressive reign of Mr. Jones, they put all their trust in him. Napoleon and Squealer feed the animals lies to justify their strenuous work, ignoring their health.

                        Additionally, Napoleon uses Snowball as a scapegoat and common enemy for the animals. Through the use of propaganda and fear tactics, he convinces the animals that any misfortune that falls onto the farm is Snowball’s fault, distracting the animals from his own failures. Orwell displays the gradual increase in control that oppressive, authoritarian regimes can have with the use of propaganda and manipulation, revealing the true power of these tools.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Napoleon’s authoritarian regime and need for power leads him to ignore the revolutionary ideals which initially gave him power, as Stalin did during his reign over Russia. Orwell shows that power and corruption will create leaders who lie, manipulate, and stray away from the ideals that gave them their power, no matter the political ideology they have. The ending of the book displays this effect as the pigs become the oppressors they fought against many years before. It symbolizes the complete betrayal of the original goals of the revolution. Orwell shows that, without accountability, any revolution can become the same oppression it sought to end.
